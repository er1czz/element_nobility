# Element Nobility
### Element nobility index was proposed by Hedge et al 2018 and 2020 to quantify the reactivity of inorganic materials.   
### The index value was calculated based on their studies on the phase stability network.
### The code is part of the project to predict phase stability in inorganic binary systems.
