# Mapping Element Nobility on Periodic Table
- Element nobility index was proposed by Hedge et al 2018 and 2020 to quantify the reactivity of inorganic materials.   
- Nobility index values ranging from -2.84 to 2.94 were calculated through their studies on phase stability network. 
- The index value is inversely correlated to the element reactivity. Low value means high reactivity, and vice versa. (e.g. F -2.84 and He 2.94)

The nobility values are listed below the element symbol. Some elements have not been indexed.  

This work is part of my project to predict stable phases in inorganic binary systems.
