# Element Nobility
- Element nobility index was proposed by Hedge et al 2018 and 2020 to quantify the reactivity of inorganic materials.   
- Nobility index values ranging from -2.84 to 2.94 were calculated by their studies on phase stability network. 
- The index value is inversely correlated to the element reactivity. Low value means high reactivity, and vice versa. (e.g. F -2.84 and He 2.94)
