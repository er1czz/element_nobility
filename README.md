# Element Nobility
- Element nobility index was proposed by Hedge et al 2018 and 2020 to quantify the reactivity of inorganic materials.   
- Index value was calculated based on their studies on the phase stability network, inversely correlated to the element reactivity. Low value means high reactivity.
- This content was derived from my project to predict stable phases in inorganic binary systems.
